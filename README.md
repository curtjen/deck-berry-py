# deck-berry-py

## Usage

`app.py` is the entry point for the application. This is still a work in progress.

## Working with Repl.it

### To Run the Application

Update `run` in the `.replit` file to have the path to the `app.py` file, like so:

```
run = "python app.py"
```

### While testing

Update `run` in the `.replit` file to have the path to the test you're running. It should look something like:

```
run = "python tests/_player.py"
```
